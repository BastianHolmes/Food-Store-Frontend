# Food-Store-Frontend
This project is a great React js training for me. Here I use a large number of hooks( useState, useReducer, useContext, useEffect).
It helps me to master modern approaches to creating React apps. I use CSS modules for styling, because it has better performance.
That's it for now, I will upgrade this project in future. The next step is implementing form with validation and connecting this app to easy backend with Firebase.
